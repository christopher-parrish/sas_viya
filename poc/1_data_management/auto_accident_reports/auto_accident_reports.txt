"On 2025-07-31 at approximately 10:45 AM EDT, I, Officer J. Smith, responded to a motor vehicle collision at the intersection of Main St and Elm Ave. Upon arrival, two vehicles were involved: a 2018 Honda Civic (Unit 1) and a 2022 Toyota Camry (Unit 2). Driver of Unit 1, Jane Doe, stated she was traveling southbound on Main St and was momentarily distracted by her car radio, causing her to not notice Unit 2 stopped ahead. Unit 1 subsequently impacted the rear of Unit 2. Driver of Unit 2, John Smith, stated he was stopped at the intersection, waiting to make a left turn onto Elm Ave, when his vehicle was struck from behind by Unit 1. A passenger in Unit 1, Emily Doe, complained of minor neck pain but refused EMS transport. Based on driver statements, witness testimony, and physical evidence at the scene (lack of skid marks from Unit 1, rear-end damage to Unit 2, front-end damage to Unit 1), it is determined that Unit 1 failed to reduce speed and was inattentive, leading to the collision. No citations were issued at the scene, but a warning was given to the driver of Unit 1 regarding distracted driving. Unit 1 was towed from the scene due to damage."

"On 10/15/2025 at approximately 10:45 hrs, I was dispatched to a report of a head-on collision on Oak Street. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles, a blue 2021 Ford Focus (Vehicle 1) and a gray 2019 Subaru Outback (Vehicle 2), with extensive front-end damage. Both vehicles were obstructing the southbound lane of Oak Street. Driver of Vehicle 1, David Miller, stated that he was reaching for a bottle of water on the passenger seat and momentarily took his eyes off the road. When he looked up, he saw he was in the opposing lane of traffic and could not avoid a collision with the oncoming vehicle. Driver of Vehicle 2, Jessica Lee, stated that she was driving southbound when she saw Vehicle 1 veer across the center line. She immediately applied her brakes and attempted to swerve to the right, but a direct head-on collision occurred. Based on the evidence at the scene, including the point of impact and statements from both drivers, it was determined that Vehicle 1 was at fault for crossing into the opposing lane of traffic and causing the collision. Both drivers and the passenger from Vehicle 2 were transported to Springfield Community Hospital for minor injuries."

"On October 23, 2023, at approximately 4:00 PM, I, Officer Sarah Williams, responded to a reported motor vehicle collision at the intersection of Maple Ave and 5th St in Springfield. Upon arrival at the scene, I observed three vehicles involved in a minor collision. 2019 Nissan Altima (Driven by Emily Carter): The Altima was positioned at the intersection with its rear end facing me. Upon inspection, I noted a 12-inch dent in the rear bumper, accompanied by scratch marks indicative of paint transfer from the vehicle behind it. The taillight remained intact, but the bumper was misaligned. 2021 Subaru Forester (Driven by Brian Lee): The Subaru was located in the middle of the intersection, with its front end showing noticeable damage. The front bumper had a 6-inch crack on the passenger side, with significant scratches and a dislodged fog light. The driver expressed concern regarding potential internal damage but confirmed the vehicle remained operational. 2016 Chevrolet Silverado (Driven by Laura Martinez): The Silverado was situated behind the Nissan Altima. Inspection revealed minimal damage; the rear bumper had superficial scratches and a small 3-inch dent. The tailgate and overall functionality of the truck remained unaffected. According to statements from the drivers involved, the sequence of events leading to the collision appeared to be a misunderstanding of right-of-way rules at the intersection. Emily Carter, driving the Nissan Altima, stated she was in the process of making a left turn when Brian Lee, in the Subaru Forester, entered the intersection simultaneously, leading to the impact. Laura Martinez, driving the Silverado, reported that she had been following the Altima and was drawn into the collision. All drivers were cooperative and provided their insurance details for reference. No injuries were reported at the scene, and the assessment confirmed that all damage incurred was cosmetic rather than structural. I advised the drivers on their insurance processing options and recommended that they obtain repair estimates for the damages. Both Emily Carter and Brian Lee indicated plans to proceed with repairs, while Laura Martinez decided not to file any claims due to the minor nature of her vehicle's damage. No citations were issued, as there were no indicators of negligence on the part of any driver. The vehicles were left at the scene pending arrangements made by their owners for towing or repairs. The intersection was cleared of debris and traffic resumed normally shortly thereafter."

"On 03/23/2026 at approximately 09:10 hrs, I, P.O. Maria Lopez (Badge Number 9876) of the Greenville Police Department, was dispatched to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Industrial Avenue. The incident involved four vehicles in a chain-reaction sequence. The at-fault vehicle, a black 2022 Honda Accord (Vehicle 1, License Plate LMN-123), was driven by Jacob Riley (DOB 09/20/1997, License Number R998877665, Address 321 Elm Street, Greenville, USA). Mr. Riley stated he was distracted by his phone and failed to notice the slowing traffic ahead. This caused him to rear-end a silver 2020 Chevrolet Traverse (Vehicle 2, License Plate OPQ-456), driven by Emily Carter (DOB 02/14/1985, License Number C554433221, Address 654 Willow Lane, Greenville, USA), who had one passenger, her son, aged 7. The force of this initial impact pushed Vehicle 2 forward into a red 2018 Mazda CX-5 (Vehicle 3, License Plate RST-789), driven by Michael White (DOB 07/07/1972, License Number W112233445, Address 987 Pine Drive, Greenville, USA). The impact between Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3 was minor, as Mr. White was already beginning to brake. The final vehicle in the chain, a white 2024 Ford F-150 (Vehicle 4, License Plate UVW-012), driven by Samantha Turner (DOB 05/29/1990, License Number T221133445, Address 111 River Road, Greenville, USA), was stopped at the traffic light and was lightly bumped by the rear of Vehicle 3. Based on driver statements and the position of the vehicles, Mr. Riley was cited for distracted driving and failure to maintain an assured clear distance. The damage to Vehicle 1 was extensive front-end damage, while Vehicle 2 sustained moderate front and rear damage. Vehicle 3 had minor front-end damage and barely noticeable rear damage. Vehicle 4 had only minor cosmetic damage to its front bumper. No witnesses other than the involved parties were present at the time of the investigation. All drivers and the one passenger were assessed by medical services at the scene and released."

"On October 24, 2023, at approximately 3:15 PM, I, Officer Michael Thompson, was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident involving two vehicles at the intersection of Main St and Oak St in Springfield. Upon arrival, I observed both vehicles positioned in the northeast quadrant of the intersection. 2018 Honda Civic (Driven by Sarah Johnson): The Honda Civic was located in the front left position of the intersection. The front bumper displayed significant damage, including a crushed grille and a broken headlight, consistent with a front-end collision. There were also dents on the hood and the passenger-side fender. The driver, Sarah Johnson, reported that her vehicle was still operational but the damage was extensive. 2022 Ford F-150 (Driven by Kevin Mitchell): The Ford F-150 was positioned at an angle, with the passenger side facing the intersection. I observed minor damage, including a scratch on the passenger door and a small dent near the rear wheel well. The driver, Kevin Mitchell, stated that his vehicle was not affected significantly and remained operable. According to statements taken from both drivers at the scene, the accident occurred when Sarah Johnson, operating the Honda Civic, was attempting to turn left onto Oak St from Main St. Kevin Mitchell, driving the Ford F-150, was traveling straight along Main St in the opposite direction when the collision occurred. Sarah stated she believed she had adequate clearance to make the turn, while Kevin reported he was traveling at a moderate speed and had not anticipated her turning in front of him. Both drivers confirmed that there were no traffic control signals present at the intersection. Determination of Fault After assessing the evidence and statements, it was determined that Sarah Johnson was at fault for failing to yield the right-of-way while making a left turn. Due to this conclusion, I issued Sarah a citation for “Failure to Yield,” which carries a fine and will be reported to her insurance provider. Both drivers expressed their intent to file insurance claims due to the accident: Sarah Johnson (Honda Civic): Given the extensive damage to her vehicle, Sarah will likely file a claim through her insurance to cover the costs of repair. She may also seek compensation for any potential loss of use while the vehicle is being repaired. Kevin Mitchell (Ford F-150): Although his vehicle sustained only minor damages, Kevin plans to file a claim for vehicle damage and any associated costs, even if they are minimal. His insurance may cover repairs for the scratches and dent, depending on his deductible level. Both vehicles were advised to move to a safe location nearby, and arrangements for towing were discussed. The scene was cleared, and traffic resumed shortly after the incident. The case will be documented, and copies of this report will be filed for future reference and insurance purposes."

"On 03/24/2026 at approximately 14:30 hrs, I, P.O. Jessica Ramirez (Badge Number 4321) of the Oceanside Police Department, was dispatched to a report of a motor vehicle collision at the intersection of Maple and Main Street. The incident involved two vehicles. Vehicle 1, a white 2023 Kia Seltos (License Plate JKL-567), was driven by Sarah Peterson (DOB 11/05/1993, License Number P998877665, Address 456 Oak Avenue, Oceanside, USA). Vehicle 2, a black 2021 Toyota Camry (License Plate MNO-890), was driven by Christopher Johnson (DOB 06/15/1988, License Number J112233445, Address 789 Birch Drive, Oceanside, USA). Based on witness statements and evidence at the scene, Vehicle 1 failed to yield at a stop sign while making a left turn onto Main Street, resulting in a T-bone collision with Vehicle 2. The impact occurred in the intersection, with Vehicle 1 striking the passenger side of Vehicle 2. Mr. Johnson stated that he was proceeding through the intersection and had the right of way when Ms. Peterson's vehicle entered his path. Ms. Peterson admitted that she did not see the other vehicle due to a momentary lapse in attention. Based on her admission and the physical evidence, Ms. Peterson was determined to be at fault for the collision. A citation for Failure to Yield at a Stop Sign (Statute § 678.90) was issued to Ms. Peterson. The damage to Vehicle 1 was moderate front-end damage, while Vehicle 2 sustained extensive damage to its passenger side, with the door and fender severely crumpled. Vehicle 2 was rendered non-drivable and required towing. Due to the nature of the collision, it is likely that the insurance claim will involve Ms. Peterson's liability coverage to compensate for the damage to Mr. Johnson's vehicle and any potential bodily injury claims. Mr. Johnson may also file a claim under his own collision coverage, but his insurer would then seek subrogation from Ms. Peterson's insurance company. Both drivers were assessed for minor injuries at the scene and did not require hospitalization."

"On September 8, 2025, at approximately 1542 hours, I, Officer Daniel R. Mendoza (#4172), was dispatched to a reported traffic collision involving multiple vehicles at the intersection of Westbrook Avenue and Maple Drive in Fairview City. Upon arrival, I observed four vehicles involved in the incident with varying degrees of damage. Vehicle 1 was a 2019 Toyota Camry (Blue) bearing NY registration KZT-4321, operated by Driver: Emily Carter (F/W, DOB 06/12/1989, Fairview City). Vehicle 1 sustained moderate front-end damage from colliding into the rear of Vehicle 2. The airbag deployed. Driver Carter reported minor chest pain but declined medical transport. No passengers were present. Vehicle 2 was a 2021 Ford Explorer (White) bearing NY registration MHG-2284, operated by Driver: Marcus Johnson (M/B, DOB 02/21/1982, Fairview City). Vehicle 2 sustained heavy rear-end damage and moderate front-end damage as a result of being struck by Vehicle 1 and subsequently pushed into Vehicle 3. Mr. Johnson complained of neck stiffness and was evaluated on scene by EMS. He was transported voluntarily to Fairview General Hospital for further examination. Vehicle 3 was a 2017 Honda Accord (Silver) bearing NY registration XLR-5902, operated by Driver: Sarah Delgado (F/H, DOB 09/30/1993, Fairview City). Vehicle 3 sustained minor rear bumper damage. No injuries were reported by Driver Delgado or her passenger, Jacob Lee (M/A, DOB 04/11/1996). Vehicle 4 was a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado (Black) bearing NY registration QTN-8475, operated by Driver: David Miller (M/W, DOB 12/07/1976, Fairview City). Vehicle 4 was stopped at the intersection ahead of Vehicle 3 and sustained very light cosmetic damage (scratched rear bumper) when Vehicle 3 was pushed forward. Driver Miller reported no injuries. Witness statements and roadway evidence indicate that Driver Emily Carter (Vehicle 1) failed to maintain proper control and did not stop in time for traffic halted at the red light. As a result, Vehicle 1 struck Vehicle 2 at a moderate speed, initiating a chain reaction collision involving Vehicles 3 and 4. Based on my investigation, Driver Emily Carter (Vehicle 1) was found at fault for following too closely and failure to control speed. Carter was issued Citation #FC-90127 under NY VTL §1129(a) (Following Too Closely). Insurance/Claims: Vehicle 1 (Toyota Camry – Emily Carter): Significant repair claim; liability claim expected against Carter’s insurance. Vehicle 2 (Ford Explorer – Marcus Johnson): Likely total loss due to front and rear damage; injury claim (neck injury) anticipated. Vehicle 3 (Honda Accord – Sarah Delgado): Minor property damage claim; possible medical claim if delayed injuries arise. Vehicle 4 (Chevrolet Silverado – David Miller): Minor cosmetic repair claim. EMS responded and transported one subject (Driver Marcus Johnson). All other involved parties declined medical transport. No fatalities occurred. Tow services removed Vehicles 1 and 2 due to inoperability. This concludes my report."

"On 03/24/2026 at approximately 10:45 hrs, I, P.O. David Miller (Badge Number 8765) of the Springfield Police Department, was dispatched to a multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Elm Street and First Avenue. The incident involved four vehicles in a chain reaction, which was initiated when Vehicle 1, a blue 2020 Nissan Sentra (License Plate RTV-345), driven by Kevin Davis (DOB 04/22/1996, License Number D543216789, Address 901 Park Avenue, Springfield, USA), failed to stop at a red light. The driver of Vehicle 1, Mr. Davis, admitted he was traveling too fast to stop safely at the intersection. As a result, his vehicle T-boned Vehicle 2, a gray 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee (License Plate SXY-678), driven by Maria Gonzalez (DOB 08/11/1984, License Number G112233445, Address 234 Willow Drive, Springfield, USA), who had just entered the intersection on a green light. The force of the impact pushed Vehicle 2 into a green 2022 Subaru Forester (Vehicle 3, License Plate WYZ-901), driven by Thomas Lee (DOB 12/03/1979, License Number L987654321, Address 567 Maple Lane, Springfield, USA), which was stopped in the turn lane. The collision between Vehicle 2 and 3 was minor, but it caused Vehicle 3 to lurch forward and lightly tap the rear bumper of a red 2021 Volkswagen Jetta (Vehicle 4, License Plate ABC-234), driven by Olivia Brown (DOB 01/17/1991, License Number B556677889, Address 890 Elm Street, Springfield, USA), who was also stopped at the intersection. Based on the evidence and statements, Mr. Davis was found to be at fault for the collision and was issued a citation for Running a Red Light (Statute § 456.78). The damage to Vehicle 1 was extensive front-end damage, rendering it non-drivable. Vehicle 2 sustained significant damage to its driver's side and required towing. Vehicle 3 had minor damage to its front bumper and Vehicle 4 had only a small dent on its rear bumper. Due to the nature of the collision, it is likely that Mr. Davis's liability insurance will be responsible for the damages to all three other vehicles and any related bodily injury claims. Ms. Gonzalez reported moderate neck and back pain and was transported to the hospital by paramedics for evaluation. Mr. Lee and Ms. Brown reported no injuries. Mr. Davis was assessed at the scene and released. It is probable that Ms. Gonzalez will file a personal injury protection (PIP) claim, and her insurance company will subrogate against Mr. Davis's liability coverage."

"On 03/24/2026 at approximately 23:15 hrs, I, P.O. Samuel Evans (Badge Number 2299) of the Lakeside Police Department, was dispatched to a single-vehicle collision on W. Lake Shore Drive. Upon arrival, I observed a blue 2022 Ford Mustang (License Plate XYZ-789), driven by Mark Thompson (DOB 10/12/1999, License Number T876543210, Address 123 Riverfront Road, Lakeside, USA), that had collided with a streetlight pole on the side of the road. Mr. Thompson stated that he was the sole occupant of the vehicle and was traveling eastbound on Lake Shore Drive. According to his statement, he momentarily looked down at his car's navigation system and, upon looking back up, realized he had drifted off the road. He overcorrected, lost control of the vehicle, and struck the streetlight pole. Mr. Thompson was found to be at fault for the accident due to distracted driving. He was issued a citation for Failure to Maintain Lane Control (Statute § 321.05). The vehicle sustained extensive front-end damage and was rendered inoperable. It was towed from the scene by a local towing service. Mr. Thompson reported a minor cut to his forehead but declined transport to the hospital, stating he would seek private medical attention. No other parties or property were involved in the collision. Given that this was a single-vehicle accident with the driver at fault, the insurance claim will likely be filed under Mr. Thompson's collision coverage to cover the damage to his own vehicle. His liability coverage may be used to compensate the city for the damage to the streetlight pole, which is considered third-party property damage."

"On September 6, 2024, at approximately 2:47 PM, I, Sergeant Maria E. Rodriguez (Badge #4429), responded to a single-vehicle motor vehicle accident in the 1200 block of Maple Ridge Drive. Upon arrival, I observed a silver 2019 Honda Civic (NC License Plate: HKM-9374, VIN: 1HGBH41JXMN109582) that had collided with a large oak tree on the east side of the roadway. The vehicle was operated by James Matthew Sinclair (DOB: 03/15/1987, DL #: NC-847293651, Address: 2847 Willow Creek Lane, Apex, NC 27502). Mr. Sinclair was conscious and alert but complained of neck pain and dizziness. The front passenger seat was occupied by his girlfriend, Rebecca Lynn Torres (DOB: 08/22/1991, Address: 1456 Pine Valley Court, Raleigh, NC 27603), who sustained minor lacerations to her right forearm from broken glass and complained of shoulder pain from the seatbelt restraint. Emergency Medical Services arrived at 2:52 PM and transported both occupants to WakeMed Cary Hospital as a precautionary measure. Mr. Sinclair was treated for minor whiplash and released the same day. Ms. Torres received five stitches for her arm lacerations and was also released after treatment. Through investigation and witness statements, I determined that Mr. Sinclair was traveling northbound on Maple Ridge Drive at approximately 45 mph in a 35 mph zone when he became distracted by his cellular phone, which had fallen between the seats. While attempting to retrieve the device, he lost control of the vehicle, crossed into the opposing lane, overcorrected to the right, and subsequently struck the oak tree. Skid marks measuring 47 feet were observed leading from the point where the vehicle left the roadway to the point of impact. Mr. Sinclair admitted to speeding and acknowledged that he had momentarily taken his eyes off the road to reach for his phone. A witness, Dorothy Anne Mitchell (Address: 1298 Maple Ridge Drive), corroborated this account, stating she observed the Honda weaving before leaving the roadway. No evidence of alcohol or drug impairment was detected, and Mr. Sinclair declined field sobriety testing, appearing completely sober. The Honda Civic sustained extensive front-end damage with deployment of both front airbags. The vehicle was deemed a total loss and was towed by Murphy's Towing Service to their facility at 3847 Industrial Boulevard, Cary, NC."

"On September 7, 2024, at approximately 8:23 AM, I, Officer Daniel P. Washington (Badge #3847), responded to a two-vehicle motor vehicle accident at the intersection of Kildaire Farm Road and Tryon Road. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles with significant damage positioned in the middle of the intersection. Vehicle 1: A red 2021 Ford F-150 pickup truck (NC License Plate: TBR-4826, VIN: 1FTFW1ET5MKC67394) was positioned facing southwest in the intersection with extensive front-end damage. The vehicle was operated by Angela Christine Davis (DOB: 06/11/1979, DL #: NC-592847361, Address: 4521 Brookhaven Circle, Apex, NC 27523). Ms. Davis was uninjured but visibly shaken. Her passenger, her 14-year-old daughter Emma Rose Davis (DOB: 01/08/2010, Address: same as driver), sustained a minor head contusion and complained of neck pain. Vehicle 2: A white 2018 Subaru Outback (NC License Plate: MNP-7841, VIN: 4S4BSAFC6J3267851) was positioned facing north with severe damage to the driver's side. The vehicle was operated by Marcus Anthony Rodriguez (DOB: 12/03/1985, DL #: NC-736291845, Address: 1847 Windcrest Drive, Cary, NC 27519). Mr. Rodriguez sustained a fractured left wrist and complained of chest pain from the seatbelt impact. His passenger, his wife Sarah Elizabeth Rodriguez (DOB: 09/17/1987, Address: same as driver), sustained bruising to her left shoulder and complained of dizziness. Emergency Medical Services arrived at 8:31 AM. Emma Davis and both occupants of the Subaru were transported to WakeMed Cary Hospital. Emma was treated for a minor concussion and released to her mother the same day. Marcus Rodriguez underwent X-rays confirming a fractured left radius and was placed in a cast; he was released after four hours. Sarah Rodriguez was evaluated for possible concussion but was cleared and released after observation. Through investigation, witness statements, and examination of the traffic signal timing, I determined that Ms. Davis was traveling eastbound on Tryon Road approaching the intersection with a green traffic light. Mr. Rodriguez was traveling southbound on Kildaire Farm Road and proceeded through the intersection against a red traffic light, failing to stop. The collision occurred when the front of Ms. Davis's F-150 struck the driver's side of Mr. Rodriguez's Subaru at an estimated combined speed of 70 mph (Davis: 35 mph, Rodriguez: 35 mph). Witness testimony from Jennifer Marie Foster (Address: 8847 Kildaire Farm Road), who was stopped at the red light behind Mr. Rodriguez, confirmed that he proceeded through the intersection without stopping despite the clearly visible red traffic signal. Ms. Foster stated the light had been red for approximately three seconds before Mr. Rodriguez entered the intersection. Traffic camera footage from the intersection corroborated this account. Mr. Rodriguez admitted he was running late for work and acknowledged he "may have misjudged" the traffic signal. He appeared sober and showed no signs of impairment. However, I observed he was holding his cellular phone when I first approached his vehicle, though he denied using it while driving. Phone records were not obtained as it was not deemed necessary for this investigation. Both vehicles sustained extensive damage and were towed from the scene. The Ford F-150 was towed by Champion Auto Recovery to their facility at 2847 Corporate Drive, Cary, NC. The Subaru Outback was towed by Reliable Towing to Miller's Auto Body at 5623 Western Boulevard, Raleigh, NC. Mr. Marcus Anthony Rodriguez is determined to be 100% at fault for this accident due to: Failure to obey traffic control device (proceeding through red traffic light) Right-of-way violation No contributing factors from the other driver, who had the right-of-way with a green light Weather conditions (light rain) were not a significant contributing factor. All occupants were properly restrained with seatbelts Airbags deployed in both vehicles Intersection traffic signals were functioning properly Light rain may have contributed to slightly longer stopping distances but was not a primary factor Scene cleared at 10:15 AM Traffic was diverted around intersection for approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes."

"On September 8, 2024, at approximately 5:47 PM, I, Lieutenant Katherine M. Hayes (Badge #4512), along with Trooper Michael J. Foster (Badge #7293), responded to a five-vehicle chain-reaction collision on Interstate 40 Eastbound at Mile Marker 287.3. The accident occurred during severe weather conditions with heavy rainfall and dense fog reducing visibility to approximately one-quarter mile. Vehicle 1 (Initial Striking Vehicle): A black 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe (NC License Plate: GBX-5829, VIN: 1GNSKCKC5LR158743) operated by Christopher Alan Brennan (DOB: 04/22/1976, DL #: NC-948372516, Address: 3847 Stonegate Drive, Durham, NC 27707). Mr. Brennan was accompanied by his wife, Patricia Lynn Brennan (DOB: 07/15/1978, Address: same as driver), and their two children: Tyler James Brennan, age 12 (DOB: 11/30/2011) and Madison Grace Brennan, age 9 (DOB: 03/17/2015). All occupants sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Vehicle 2: A silver 2017 Toyota Camry (NC License Plate: FMR-7164, VIN: 4T1BF1FK8HU392847) operated by Dr. Rajesh Kumar Patel (DOB: 09/08/1965, DL #: NC-627394851, Address: 7821 Briarcliff Court, Raleigh, NC 27615). Dr. Patel was alone in the vehicle and sustained moderate injuries including a broken collarbone. Vehicle 3: A white 2019 Honda CR-V (NC License Plate: KJP-9283, VIN: 7FARW2H58KE147529) operated by Elizabeth Marie Thompson (DOB: 01/28/1990, DL #: NC-516847392, Address: 2947 Meadowbrook Lane, Cary, NC 27518). Ms. Thompson's passenger was her elderly mother, Dorothy Ann Thompson (DOB: 05/14/1948, Address: 5628 Sunset Ridge Road, Apex, NC 27502). Both sustained minor injuries. Vehicle 4: A red 2022 Nissan Altima (NC License Plate: NPT-4627, VIN: 1N4BL4BV8NC184759) operated by Kevin Michael O'Connor (DOB: 12/07/1982, DL #: NC-739184625, Address: 8473 Willow Creek Boulevard, Holly Springs, NC 27540). Mr. O'Connor was traveling alone and sustained serious injuries including multiple rib fractures and internal bleeding. Vehicle 5: A blue 2018 Ford Explorer (NC License Plate: HRT-8394, VIN: 1FM5K8D87JGA58291) operated by Maria Isabel Santos (DOB: 08/30/1995, DL #: NC-847293716, Address: 4521 Pine Valley Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603). Ms. Santos was accompanied by her boyfriend, David Anthony Miller (DOB: 06/19/1993, Address: 1847 Oakwood Street, Raleigh, NC 27604). Both sustained minor injuries. The collision sequence began when Mr. Brennan, traveling at approximately 70 mph in heavy rain and fog conditions, failed to observe stopped or slow-moving traffic ahead due to a separate minor accident that had occurred 10 minutes earlier. Despite electronic message boards 2 miles prior warning of the hazard and reduced speed limits, Mr. Brennan did not reduce his speed appropriately for conditions. His Tahoe struck the rear of Dr. Patel's Camry, which was traveling at approximately 25 mph due to the hazardous conditions. The impact caused Dr. Patel's Camry to be propelled forward into the Honda CR-V operated by Ms. Thompson, which was traveling at approximately 30 mph. The Thompson vehicle was then pushed into Mr. O'Connor's Nissan Altima, which had been traveling at 35 mph and attempting to change lanes to avoid the developing situation. Finally, the Altima collided with Ms. Santos's Ford Explorer, which was in the left lane traveling at approximately 40 mph. Multiple witnesses confirmed that Mr. Brennan was following too closely and traveling too fast for the weather conditions. Witness Carl Robert Jenkins (Address: 5847 Forest Hills Drive, Raleigh, NC), driving in the adjacent lane, stated he observed the Tahoe approaching at high speed and "not slowing down at all" despite the clearly hazardous conditions and the line of slower-moving vehicles ahead. Emergency Medical Services from Wake County arrived at 6:02 PM, with additional units from Johnston County arriving at 6:08 PM due to the multiple injuries. Life Flight helicopter was dispatched for Mr. O'Connor due to the severity of his injuries but was unable to land due to weather conditions. He was transported by ambulance to WakeMed Raleigh with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Investigation revealed that Mr. Brennan had been cited twice in the past 18 months for following too closely and once for speeding. His vehicle showed evidence of recent cell phone use, though he denied using the device while driving. Alcohol screening was negative for all drivers involved. Mr. Christopher Alan Brennan is determined to be 100% at fault for initiating this chain-reaction collision due to: Failure to reduce speed for hazardous weather conditions Following too closely for conditions (estimated 1.5 seconds behind lead vehicle) Failure to maintain proper lookout Driving at excessive speed (70 mph) given weather conditions and traffic patterns Disregarding electronic warning signs about hazardous conditions ahead"
